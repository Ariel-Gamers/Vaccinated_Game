In this game you are playing your autoimmune system.

This is a simple demo, there is an infection near your heart from a virus. When you have enough energy(3), you can call upon an immune cell to terminate it.
The immune cell will slowly deal damage to the virus until it disapepars. 

In the future, the immune cells will travel to the virus, and be specialized - some immune cells are strong against viruses, others against bacteria.

Each immune cell has health and damage, as noted in their respective scripts - `BadCell.cs` and `GoodCell.cs`
